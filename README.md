# University_managment_system

A console-based university management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The system allows adding and managing students, teachers, courses, and enrollments with clean class hierarchies and polymorphism.

## Key Features:
1. Utilized abstract classes, inheritance, and function overloading  
2. Implemented runtime polymorphism using parent class pointers to manage both student and teacher objects  
3. Ensured memory safety by dynamically allocating and cleaning up objects  
4. Designed a modular menu-driven interface for ease of use  

**Tech Used:** C++, OOP (Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction)
